Dear Razming Hovaghimian

I am Prof. Jordi-Lopez-Sintas, head of CMC research group (Consumption Markets and Culture: A leisure Research Group) at University of Autonoma Barcelona.  At the moment, we are conducting research about cultural consumption of TV series around the globe thus analysing the data available on Viki website is a great research opportunity for us. 
Our research purpose is to outstretch creative industries in the global markets.  Especially, we have been focusing on cultural products market via internet. 
My team and I strongly believe that Viki could offer us various and reliable data for TV contents consumption via internet knowing that Viki is a global video platform which has more than 35 millions of users and offers almost 200 languages. 
We are specifically interested in the relation between the content of TV series and the sentiment of the viewers. Considering the fact that Viki is strongly based on a volunteer community such as segmenting, subtitling so on it elucidates accurately how viewers approach to global contents.  We are staggered about Viki services how fast videos were uploaded and got subtitles by autonomous users.  
Thanks to your open source on Viki API page we have been approaching data which are available. But recently we have found that the data about users and subtitles of video are restricted by Viki Applications. In order to understand the consumption pattern and the sentiment of the viewers our research require specifically the data of users and subtitles of video. Therefore I would like to ask your help us to access these data in Viki. 
For us as researchers this research is also too niche and too international. It is as scarce as Viki to conduct a research about sentiment of viewers of globe video via internet. We hope that you will be interested in our research project for understanding the users who contribute “Video Wikipedia”. 
Of course we will refer to, and acknowledge your support in any potential resultant publications. 
Looking forward to hearing from you soon. 
Your sincerely
Jordi Lopez-Sintas

A part of his interview about the memo he left to his colleague in VIKI

I’ll leave you with a little drawing I’ve had in my head from my days in grad school. Had this on my Singapore desk for over a year now. We’re at the top right. Non consensus (it’s too niche, it’s too international, we don’t get it, it’s too expensive, it can’t be done, etc.) Those that took the chance on us and bought into our dream were right – that’s disruptive. Saw it on my desk again in Singapore last week on Saturday and it struck me that we are close. Here is to our moment in history! Now… go go go!!
