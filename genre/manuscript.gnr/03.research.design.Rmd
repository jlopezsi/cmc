## 3.1 Data and variables

The data for our study came from a Spanish survey on habits and cultural
practices for 2006-2007 (see Ministry of Culture (2007) for technical details).
Surveyed were 14 822 Spanish and non-Spanish individuals of both sexes, aged 15
years and older, and resident in Spain at the time of interview. The survey was
conducted in four waves (1 per quarter) between March 2006 and February 2007;
each quarterly survey was based on a representative random sample of about 25%
of the sampled individuals (all four quarterly surveys were used for our
analysis), stratified by autonomous communities and municipalities according to
size. Stratification by autonomous community was necessary to produce a
representative sample with a 95% confidence level, not only at an aggregate
level (age and gender) but also at the autonomous community level (Ministry of
Culture, 2007:11). In the interest of brevity, background data referring to the
research described below are provided in supplementary form in Tables A1-A6.

### 3.1.1 Cultural space: musical listening indicators

Individuals interviewed were asked about the kind of music he/she normally
listen to.  Individuls were given a list of musical genres and they just had to
choose the ones they usually listen to. The following multiple answers (21 in
total) were possible: songs for children (chl), songwriters (swr), ballads
(bls), flamenco (flk),  new flamenco (nfl), other spanish folk songs (flk),
international pop rock (ipp), Spanihs poprock (spp), latino poprock (lpp),
blues (bls), jazz (jzz), world music (wrl), reggea (rgg), rap (rap), electronic
music and techno (tcn), hardrock (hrk), house (hus), classical music (cls),
Lyrical music (lyr), opera (opr), operetta (opt). Desciptors are provided in
Table~\ref{tab:stat.genres}. 

### 3.1.2. Social space: indicators of individual position

According to Bourdieu???s theoretical framework, the properties of individuals
are indicators of their social position, such that variations in individual
properties ??? level and structure of capital, age, gender, etc. ??? are
variations in the individual???s social position that are visible in a social
map. The Ministry of Culture survey on which we based our research elicited
information on education as an indicator of cultural capital, and on
occupational status as an indicator of economic capital, but provided no
occupational breakdown, and collected no information on incomes. As a proxy for
economic capital in our study, therefore, we used occupational status,  namely,
the following five categories: employed persons; entrepreneurs and
self-employed workers (freelancers); unemployed persons; people receiving
old-age or disability pensions and individuals performing unpaid domestic tasks
(homemakers); and students. Educational attainment was recorded in three
categories, as follows: third-level post-graduate education, third-level
graduate education, and upper secondary education or below. Age, interpreted
here as an indicator of an individual???s life stage, was assigned to five
categories. In order to complete the description of the social space, four
additional variables were included, as follows: personal situation (five
categories); number of individuals aged 15 and over in the household (three
categories); habitat where the household was located (five categories); and sex
(Table~\ref{tab:stat.descriptors}).

#### 3.2.1.1 Correlation Classification Analysis

Coorelation Classification Analysis (CCA) is a method to measure shared cultural
schemas in survey data, developed by Andrei Boutyline (2014). 


At the core of CCA's approach is a novel similarity measure termed
"correlational class" which Goldberg states can quantify the extent to which two
respondents organize their attitudes according to such a shared cultural
schema. RCA calculates the relationality scores for each pair of respondents

Pearson’s correlation is often interpreted as the "measure of the degree of
linear relationship between two variables" (Stockburger 2007; see Rodgers and
Nicewander 1988 for a detailed treatment). Thus, Pearson's correlation appears
to be a perfect candidate for this task.



At the core of RCA’s approach is a novel similarity measure termed
“relationality,” which Goldberg contends can quantify the extent to which two
respondents organize their attitudes according to such a shared cultural
schema. RCA calculates the relationality scores for each pair of respondents
and interprets the result as an adjacency matrix for a valued network, where
the nodes are individual survey respondents and ties between them are their
pairwise relationalities. After adjusting tie strengths for a bias in the
relationality measure and dropping weaker ties, it partitions the network via
Newman’s (2006) eigenvector-based modularity maximization algorithm, which
assigns individuals to groups so that relationality scores are high within
groups, and lower between groups.

Goldberg (2011) developed relationality as a tool to detect shared cultural
schemas in survey data—a novel methodological task that is, in itself, a bold
conceptual innovation. However, existing work on RCA does not provide a formal
definition of shared cultural schemas, making relationality’s performance
difficult to analyze. As I demonstrate below, however, the theoretical
reasoning behind RCA easily yields such a definition. Moreover, this
formalization reveals that, in order to detect shared cultural schemas,
relationality must measure the degree of linear dependency between two vectors
of responses—the same quantity for which Pearson’s correlation is a
long-established measure. When I revisit Goldberg’s introductory example
(Goldberg 2011:1404-1405) with Pearson’s correlation, I discover that it
produces a substantially more accurate result than Goldberg’s relationality.
