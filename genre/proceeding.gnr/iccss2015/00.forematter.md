Research into the meaning of cultural classifications has usually distinguished
between cultural schemes--discourses--and taste groups . Cultural schemes
classifies cultural expressions according to the meaning individuals attribute
to them and have favoured structural analysis conducted with Geometric Data
Analysis methods. Taste groups, instead have been approached as descriptions of
groups of individuals’ taste patterns combining the cultural schemes found in
the structural analysis through clustering methods (van Eijck \& Lievens 2008).
In the former case one classies cultural expressions, in the latter,
individuals. But the structural analysis implicitly supposes that all
individuals share the same schemas of cultural classification, and the
clustering, loses the shared cultural schemes.

However whether all individuals share the same schemas of cultural
classification is an empirical matter and its interpretation, a theoretical one.
May be the seminal work of  Bourdieu (1984) is  one of few works that implicitly
acknowledges the existence of heterogeneous cultural schemes, that we calls
habitus,  however he is only interested in the homology between the spaces of
cultural practices, preferences and social space. This means that he was not
interested in whether young and middle age individuals differ in the way they
classify cultural expressions, holding constant their social classes.

One way of overcoming this limitation is applying a new family of methods called
Relational Class Analysis (Goldberg 2011). RCA aims at measuring and revealing
shared cultural schemes. However, instead of using Goldberg’s measure of
relationality to quantify how much two individuals share a cultural schema, we
use Pearson’s correlations between individuals music tastes to form a matrix for
a valued network, where the nodes are respondents and ties between them are
their pairwise correlations. We used corclass package (Boutyline 2013)
implemented in the R language and Environment for Data Analysis (R Core team
2014). Then we partition the network via Newman’s (2006) eigenvector-based
modularity maximization algorithm, which assigns individuals to groups so that
Pearson’s correlation are high within groups and lower between them.

The data for our study came from a Spanish survey on habits and cultural
practices for 2006-2007 (see Ministry of Culture (2007) for technical details).
Individuals interviewed were asked about the kind of music they normally listen
to. They were offered 21 music genres to choose from.  The survey also recorded
the educational level, occupation, age, gender, personal situation, and
city-size.

Preliminary results shows that CCA identifies three classes in these data which
are presented in \textbf{Figure 1} The first class features practically no negative
correlations between the genres while there are few weak negative correlation
toward ballad. This class could be named as “Omnivore-Univore”. The second class
located by CCA appears to be defined by an opposition between newer mucial
genres (e.g. rap, house, electronic music and hardrock) on one extreme, and more
traditional ones (e.g. opera, jazz, blues, opereta, lirical and classical
music.). This class can be identified as “Contemporary-Traditional”. The third
class shows omnivorousness among different genres with clear exceptions of
Spanish and foreign poprock. We call this class “Anything (but) Spanish
poprock”. Afterwards using Multi Correspondence Analysis (MCA) we map genre and
social class spaces, and explain underlying homology between them.

observations in the same space. \end{abstract}
