Correlational Class Analysis 2

ABSTRACT

The task of measuring shared cultural schemas is among the most central
methodological challenges in sociology of culture. Relational Class Analysis
(RCA) is a recently developed technique for identifying such schemas in survey
data. It uses a novel measure called "relationality" to quantify the extent to
which two respondents organize their attitudes according to a shared cultural
schema. However, since existing work lacks a formal definition of such schemas,
RCA’s accuracy is difficult to assess. In this paper, I build on the
theoretical reasoning behind RCA to arrive at this formal definition. In doing
so, I discover that shared cultural schemas should result in linear
dependencies between rows in a survey dataset—the same relationship as measured
by Pearson’s correlation. I thus compare relationality and correlation across a
broad range of simulations. The results indicate that switching from
"Relational" to "Correlational" Class Analysis (CCA) reliably increases
accuracy, so much so that, when the methods disagree, the odds that CCA's
results are more accurate exceed 16:1. I then revisit a prior RCA analysis of
the 1992 GSS musical tastes module with CCA, and find that the more accurate
method contradicts the controversial RCA finding that a substantial portion of
respondents organize their tastes according to the traditional distinction
between “highbrow” and “lowbrow” genres. Instead, CCA documents two classes of
respondents whose tastes echo the exclusionary omnivorousness described by
Bryson (1996), in which a handful of musical tastes closely associated with
low-education listeners are distinguished from tastes for all other genres. I
conclude by highlighting further areas for methodological improvement.

Improving the Measurement of Shared Cultural Schemas with Correlational Class Analysis

The task of revealing intelligible structures of meaning beneath complex
collections of cultural data is among the most central methodological
challenges posed by sociology of culture (Mohr and Rawlings 2012; Mohr 1998).
From the perspective of culture and cognition (DiMaggio 1997, 2011), this task
is a search for “cultural schemas”—abstract shared structures which specify
relationships between cultural elements. In a high-profile recent work,
Goldberg (2011) proposes an innovative methodology for identifying groups of
survey respondents who share such cultural schemas, which he terms Relational
Class Analysis (RCA). RCA has garnered a substantial amount of attention across
diverse domains of study including cultural tastes (Goldberg 2011), public
opinion (Goldberg and Baldassarri forthcoming; Wu forthcoming), organizational
behavior (Miranda, Summers, and Kim 2012) and economic sociology (DiMaggio and
Goldberg 2010). However, existing work has not yet provided a clear formal
definition of cultural schemas, the central concept under investigation. This
is a crucial limitation as, without such a definition, it is impossible to
quantify how well RCA measures what it purports to measure. In this paper, I
build on Goldberg’s (2011) theoretical reasoning to arrive at this missing
definition, which I then use to develop a substantially more accurate,
computationally faster, and analytically more parsimonious alternative I call
Correlational Class Analysis (CCA).  Goldberg (2011) introduces RCA using a
case study of musical tastes. Taking a cue from relational theories of meaning
(e.g., Mohr 1998; Saussure 1916 [2013];

Correlational Class Analysis 4

Emirbayer 1997), RCA searches for cultural schemas that define not the musical
tastes themselves, but the relationships between these tastes—that is, which
genre tastes are perceived as similar and which as opposed. This kind of schema
can be found in the implicit agreement between an individual who likes musical
genres A and B but dislikes genre C, and another who dislikes A and B but likes
C: though the two hold no tastes in common, they nonetheless agree that A “goes
with” B, whereas C is “opposed to” A and B. On the other hand, an individual
who likes all three of the genres A, B and C has two tastes in common with the
first individual, but does not agree that C is the opposite of A and B. Thus,
under this definition, the first two individuals arrange their tastes according
to exactly the same cultural schema, while the third one does not. 1 The goal
of RCA is to partition the survey population into classes of respondents that
share such cultural schemas.

At the core of RCA’s approach is a novel similarity measure termed
“relationality,” which Goldberg contends can quantify the extent to which two
respondents organize their attitudes according to such a shared cultural
schema. RCA calculates the relationality scores for each pair of respondents
and interprets the result as an adjacency matrix for a valued network, where
the nodes are individual survey respondents and ties between them are their
pairwise relationalities. After adjusting tie strengths for a bias in the
relationality measure and dropping weaker ties, it partitions the network via
Newman’s (2006) eigenvector-based modularity maximization algorithm, which
assigns individuals to groups so that relationality scores are high within
groups, and lower between groups.

Correlational Class Analysis 5

Goldberg (2011) developed relationality as a tool to detect shared cultural
schemas in survey data—a novel methodological task that is, in itself, a bold
conceptual innovation. However, existing work on RCA does not provide a formal
definition of shared cultural schemas, making relationality’s performance
difficult to analyze. As I demonstrate below, however, the theoretical
reasoning behind RCA easily yields such a definition. Moreover, this
formalization reveals that, in order to detect shared cultural schemas,
relationality must measure the degree of linear dependency between two vectors
of responses—the same quantity for which Pearson’s correlation is a
long-established measure. When I revisit Goldberg’s introductory example
(Goldberg 2011:1404-1405) with Pearson’s correlation, I discover that it
produces a substantially more accurate result than Goldberg’s relationality.

To verify that this difference in accuracy generalizes beyond this example, I
simulate 10,000 further test cases. The results confirm that this switch from
“Relational” to “Correlational” Class Analysis (CCA) reliably increases the
accuracy of the technique, so much so that, when the two disagree, the odds
that CCA’s result is more accurate exceed 16:1. RCA’s low relative accuracy
degrades to 23:1 when the simulated data violate a strong distributional
assumption introduced by relationality. To examine the substantive consequences
of switching to the more accurate correlation-based method, I also revisit
Goldberg’s (2011) RCA analysis of the 1993 GSS musical tastes data, and find
that CCA results differ in substantive ways from RCA’s. I conclude by
discussing the remaining limitations of the method, and by highlighting further
areas for improvement.

Correlational Class Analysis 6

SHARED SCHEMAS

Although Goldberg (2011) does not formally define what it means for a set of
respondents to share a cultural schema, he illustrates such a relationship by
way of an example and accompanying diagram, which I recreate as Figure 1 below.
Describing this figure, Goldberg states that A and B have “identical” patterns
of musical tastes, C’s pattern is “almost a mirror image” of A’s and B’s, and
D’s is “different but not antithetical.” He thus concludes that “respondents A,
B, and C exhibit the same logic of musical taste construction ... as they all
exhibit the same structure of relevance and opposition” (Goldberg 2011:1405),
whereas respondent D does not.

To arrive at a formal definition of schematic similarity, I expand Goldberg’s
discussion of this introductory example by writing out the implied algebraic
operations.  Respondent A likes pop, blues and rock, strongly likes classical
and opera, and is indifferent towards bluegrass and country: 𝐴 =
{4,4,4,5,5,3,3}. Respondent B, on the other hand, dislikes pop, blues and rock,
is indifferent towards classical and opera, and strongly dislikes bluegrass and
country: 𝐵 = {2,2,2,3,3,1,1}. Except for an overall downward shift in the
appraisal of all the genres, this pattern of tastes is identical to that of the
first respondent: 𝐵 = 𝐴 − 2.

[Figure 1 about here]

In contrast to A and B, respondent C is indifferent towards pop, blues and
rock, strongly dislikes classical and opera, and strongly likes bluegrass and
country: 𝐶 = {3,3,3,1,1,5,5}. These tastes again follow the same relative
pattern as A and B, except all tastes are vertically shifted, inverted and
amplified: 𝐶 = 2 ∗ (−1) ∗ 𝐴 + 11, or,

Correlational Class Analysis 7

equivalently, 𝐶 = 2 ∗ (−1) ∗ 𝐵 + 7. Finally, respondent D strongly dislikes pop
and rock, strongly likes blues, likes classical, opera and bluegrass, and
dislikes country: 𝐷 = {1,5,1,4,4,4,2}. Unlike A, B and C, this respondent
construes an opposition between bluegrass and country, but not between
bluegrass and opera. No series of inversions, multiplications or shifts of this
pattern can transform it into the one exhibited by A, B and C. We thus conclude
that, while respondents A, B and C follow the same schema, respondent D does
not.

From this example, we can surmise that two responds follow exactly the same
schema if (i) their attitudes are identical, (ii) their attitudes are exact
inverses of each other’s, (iii) the attitudes of either respondent are
uniformly more extreme than those of the other, (iv) the attitudes of either
respondent are uniformly more positive than of the other, or (v) any
combination of (ii), (iii) and (iv). These conditions specify the mathematical
operations of identity, inversion, scaling and vertical shift, and can thus be
captured by a single algebraic statement: two respondents X and Y follow
exactly the same schema if and only if there exists a linear transformation
that can produce one response pattern from the other one, or, more formally, if
there exist such constants b and 𝑘 ≠ 0 that 𝑌 = 𝑘𝑋 + 𝑏. It is therefore
intuitively clear that any measure of schematic similarity between two
respondents should obtain its maximum value when such k and b exist, and should
otherwise capture the degree to which one pattern can be approximated by linear
transformations of the other.

Relationality

Correlational Class Analysis 8

Goldberg (2011) offers relationality 𝑅 𝑖𝑗 as a measure of this schematic
similarity. It is computed by first taking the vector of attitudes belonging to
a single respondent and calculating the pairwise differences between each pair
of attitudes in that vector, so that each row in the survey dataset produces a
square matrix of differences between variables in that row. Then, to calculate
the relationality between a pair of respondents i and j, the absolute values of
their respective matrices are element-wise subtracted from each other, and each
element of the resulting matrix is assigned a sign based on whether the
original differences were in the same or in opposite directions. Finally, the
elements of this matrix are summed into a single variable, which is then
rescaled and recentered to range from 1 (same direction) to −1 (opposite
direction) 2. The distinction between positive and negative relationalities,
however, is not useful for RCA, as either extreme of the measure indicates that
respondents follow the same schema. Thus, in all further analyses, RCA uses
only the absolute values of the relationality |𝑅 𝑖𝑗 |, which ranges from 1
(same schema) to 0 (unrelated schemas).

The values |𝑅 𝑖𝑗 | obtains in the introductory example should thus clearly
identify that A, B and C follow exactly the same schematic pattern, but D does
not. However, relationality’s difficulties at this task are evident in Figure
1B of the original paper (Goldberg 2011:1405). I depict the relevant parts of
this diagram in Figure 2A below 3.  Relationality achieves its maximum value
for the respondent pair A and B (AB = 1.00), thus clearly indicating that the
two follow the same schema. Conversely, the absolute relationality between the
pair A and D is approximately 0.2, which is appropriately low as A and D follow
different schemas. Since C follows the same schema as A and B, the

Correlational Class Analysis 9

absolute relationalities AC and BC should optimally be equal to the same value
as AB (1.00). Unfortunately, this is not the case: both AC and BC have absolute
relationalities of approximately 0.3, which is far closer to the relationality
of the unrelated pair AD (0.2). Thus, relationality appears to grossly
understate the schematic similarity between respondent C and respondents A and
B.

[Figure 2 about here]

To determine whether this inaccuracy causes RCA to yield an incorrect solution,
I created a dataset consisting entirely of rows A, B, C and D, each repeated
200 times for a total of 800 rows. I then analyzed it with the RCA software
provided by Goldberg (Goldberg and Zhai 2013). To produce the correct solution,
RCA would have to partition this population in two classes, the first
containing all the copies of rows A, B and C (600 rows total), and the second
all copies of D (200 rows). However, RCA instead produced an erroneous solution
consisting of three distinct classes, with the copies of C incorrectly assigned
to their own class, separate from copies of A and B 4. Since Goldberg uses this
example to introduce relationality as a tool for detecting shared schemas, its
failure at this task is especially troubling.

Correlation

This shortcoming means that there is merit in trying out a different measure of
schematic similarity. Recall that two respondents X and Y exactly follow the
same schema if there exist such constants 𝑘 ≠ 0 and b such that 𝑌 = 𝑘𝑋 + 𝑏.
Thus, provided that X and Y have a finite non-zero variance, it can be easily
shown that the absolute Pearson’s

Correlational Class Analysis 10

correlation |𝑟| between X and Y equals 1 if and only if they follow exactly the
same schema. As the two responses become more and more linearly independent of
one another—that is, as the best possible linear transformation of X leaves an
ever larger percentage of Y’s variance unexplained—the value of |𝑟| decreases
monotonically towards 0. Finally, |𝑟| will be equal to 0 if and only if 𝑘 = 0
gives the best linear approximation of Y, or, in other words, if the best
linear approximation of Y ignores the contents of X altogether. This is why
Pearson’s correlation is often interpreted as the “measure of the degree of
linear relationship between two variables” (Stockburger 2007; see Rodgers and
Nicewander 1988 for a detailed treatment). Thus, Pearson’s correlation appears
to be a perfect candidate for this task.

Figure 2B demonstrates the results obtained by applying Pearson’s correlation
to the same problem. The absolute correlations AB, AC and BC all equal 1,
whereas AD, BD and CD equal 0.25. The absolute correlations between responses
that follow the same schema are thus at their theoretical maximum, while the
ones between members of different schematic classes are closer to their
minimum. Thus, correlation appears to produce a far clearer depiction of the
schematic relationships between these respondents than relationality. To
examine whether this improvement results in a correct partition into classes, I
implemented an algorithm for detecting schematic classes based on absolute row
correlations instead of relationalities, which I term Correlational Class
Analysis (CCA; see Appendix A for details). And indeed, when I applied CCA to
the same 800row dataset, it correctly assigned all the rows into the two
schematic classes present in the

Correlational Class Analysis 11

data. Thus, while RCA failed to correctly recover the schematic classes in
Goldberg’s example, CCA produced a perfect answer.

Therefore, though Goldberg asserts that relationality’s far greater
computational complexity makes it “more sensitive to interdependencies” between
the variables than correlation (Goldberg 2011: Appendix A), the analysis thus
far suggests that quite the opposite may be the case. The theory of schematic
similarity implies that the quantity these measures need to capture is the
degree of linear dependency between responses, which is exactly what is
measured by Pearson’s correlation. Thus, it is far from certain that measuring
any other kind of interdependency should aid in the search for these schema.
Moreover, Goldberg never actually provides an example of any schematic
similarity which relationality can detect but correlation cannot. On the other
hand, this introductory example presents a clear case where relationality fails
to detect a schematic similarity that is perfectly detected by correlation.

SIMULATION

The above analysis suggests that CCA is a more accurate tool than RCA for
detecting groups of respondents whose answers follow the same cultural schema.
However, one may rightfully object that a single example does not provide a
sufficient basis for drawing such a broad conclusion. To rule out the
possibility that CCA’s apparently superior performance is due to features
specific to this introductory example, I turn to simulation to carry out a more
thorough and realistic test.

Correlational Class Analysis 12

The formal definition of shared schemas can serve as the basis for such
simulations. Since two response vectors exactly follow the same schema if and
only if they are linear transformations of one another, the schema specifying
relationships between N tastes can itself be specified with a vector 𝜌 = {𝜌1 ,
𝜌2 , … , 𝜌 𝑁 }.5 Such a schema can be randomly generated by drawing a vector of
integers from an appropriate probability distribution. In turn, each response
pattern 𝑋 that exactly follows this schema can be generated by randomly drawing
a pair of linear transformation constants k and b, which can invert, rescale or
shift the pattern in ways consistent with the theory discussed earlier.
However, since real survey respondents do not perfectly reproduce cultural
schemas, a simulated response must also include substantial stochastic
deviations from the schema. These can be introduced via an independent error
vector 𝜖 of the same length as the original pattern, so that 𝑋 = 𝑘𝜌 + 𝑏 + 𝜖.
This is the basic formula behind my simulations.

To ensure that the simulations cover a wide range of potential cases, each
simulation run consists of three randomization steps. The first step randomizes
the broad characteristics of the data to be simulated in this run, such as the
ranges and variances that will be used to generate the values of 𝜌, 𝑘, 𝑏 and 𝜖,
as well as the number of distinct taste schemas behind the responses. The
second step generates these schemas using the variance parameters produced in
the first step. Finally, the third step generates a random number of
respondents following each of these schemas by applying random linear
transformation and adding random noise, both generated using the ranges and
variances set in the first step. I repeat the entire procedure 5000 times 6,
creating simulated datasets

Correlational Class Analysis 13

that widely differ in the ranges of simulated variables, variance of individual
responses, signal to noise ratio, and many other parameters. A more detailed
description of the simulation procedure can be found in Appendix B.

Figure 3 illustrates a single simulation run. The randomly determined
parameters from the first step of the run set the schema variance to 0.51,
number of schemas to 3, and the maximum error variance shift and scaling factor
to 1.02, 1 and 2, respectively.  Thus, to make the schemas 𝜌1 , 𝜌2 and 𝜌3 ,
three vectors were drawn from the normal distribution with 𝜇 = 0 and 𝜎 2 =
0.51, and rounded to the nearest integer. The resulting schemas are depicted
with solid black lines, one per plot. For each schema, the simulation created a
set of followers by randomly picking a value of shift b from {−1,1}, scaling
and inversion factor k from {−2, −1,1,2}, and a noise vector 𝜖 drawn from the
normal distribution with variance of no more than 1.02. A small sample of such
respondents is depicted in dashed gray lines behind the appropriate schema.

[Figure 3 about here]

Measuring Accuracy

This simulation thus generalizes and expands the introductory example. Each of
the 5000 simulated datasets is based around a different set of taste schemas,
and consists of a large population of simulated responses, each produced in a
theoretically consistent way from one of those schemas. Thus, as in Goldberg’s
(2011) introductory example, the true schematic class membership for each
simulated respondent is known by design. The simulation’s goal is to assess the
accuracy with which the group assignments made by the two algorithms correspond
to this known membership. If two respondents were generated

Correlational Class Analysis 14

from the same schema, they should be assigned to the same group; if they were
created from different schemas, they should belong to different groups.  For
each run, I measured this classification accuracy with Normalized Mutual

Information (NMI):

𝑁𝑀𝐼(Ω, 𝐶) =

2 ∗ 𝐼(𝛺; 𝐶)
,
𝐻(Ω) + 𝐻(𝐶)

where vector 𝐶 contains the true class memberships for every respondent, vector
Ω contains the group assignments made by the algorithm, I is mutual
information, and H is Shannon entropy. NMI is an established criterion for
measuring the accuracy of network partitioning algorithms (e.g., Danon et al.
2005; Lancichinetti, Fortunato, and Kertész 2009). It achieves its minimum of 0
when the set of memberships estimated by the algorithms is independent with
respect to the true memberships, and the maximum of 1 when the estimated
memberships perfectly recreate the true classes (Manning, Raghavan, and Schütze
2008).

Simulation Results

The results of these 5000 tests are presented in Table 1 under the heading
“Simulation 1”.  The median accuracy of CCA (0.87) is higher than that of RCA 7
(0.74), a difference that is highly significant statistically (Wilcoxon W =
8585271, p < 0.0001). The interquartile range (IQR) of CCA’s accuracy extends
from 0.69 to 0.97,while RCA’s extends 0.54 to 0.88. Thus, while CCA’s 75th
percentile is just shy of a perfect accuracy, RCA’s 75th percentile barely
surpasses CCA’s median. The substantive significance of these differences is
clearer when the CCA accuracies (Y) are plotted against the RCA

Correlational Class Analysis 15

accuracies (X) in Figure 4. While the accuracies are strongly associated (𝑅 2 =
0.79), CCA is more accurate than RCA in the vast majority of cases (88.1%). In
contrast, RCA is more accurate than CCA in only 5.2% of the cases. Thus, when
RCA and CCA disagree, which they do in 93.3% of the cases, the odds that CCA’s
result is more accurate than RCA’s exceed 16:1.

[Figure 4 about here]

[Table 1 about here]

To determine if the results point to any classes of data where RCA would be
preferable to CCA, I disaggregated them by schema variance and noise variance,
which are the parameters most responsible for the difficulty of the
classification task. Lower schema variances or higher noise variances result in
more challenging signal to noise ratios, which should make the performance of
both algorithms poorer. The loess curves demonstrating this effect are
presented in Figure 5 below. The two curves closely track each other across
both plots, again indicating that the performance of the two algorithms is
strongly related. However, CCA’s accuracy remains substantially above RCA’s
throughout the full ranges of both variances. All the classes of data that are
challenging to CCA thus appear to be even more challenging for RCA. Moreover,
RCA’s accuracy does not catch up even in tests with the least challenging
amounts of noise, which are depicted on the left side of figure 5B. Though
CCA’s average accuracy in these cases approaches 0.97, RCA’s average accuracy
never rises above 0.85.

[Figure 5 about here]

Correlational Class Analysis 16

These results also allow a comparison of CCA and RCA performance when the
schema variance is very low. In such situations, pairwise correlations between
responses tend towards zero. On the other hand, their relationalities approach
one. Thus, as Goldberg argues, the relationality between low-variance
respondents is systematically higher than the correlation. However, Goldberg
incorrectly infers that this means that “relationality does a better job at
examining relationships between respondents whose responses have relatively low
variance” (Goldberg 2011:Appendix A). The fact that relationality produces
higher values does not imply that it produces more accurate values. And indeed,
as can be seen on the left side of figure 5A, the opposite appears to be true.
As schema variance decreases to its simulation minimum of 0.3, CCA’s accuracy
drops to 0.38. However, RCA’s accuracy drops all the way down to 0.08. Thus,
RCA results for low-variance schemas appear to contain almost no information
about the true membership structure of the data. This suggests that
relationality may have an upward bias for low-variance observations that is
substantially more damaging to its performance that correlation’s downward
bias.

Distributional Assumptions

Relationality also introduces a strong distributional assumption which may
further degrade its accuracy when violated. While a correlation of zero always
indicates an absence of a linear relationship, the equivalent “null value” of
relationality differs from dataset to dataset and is generally skewed above
zero (Goldberg 2011:Appendix A). RCA attempts to compensate for this skew by
re-centering the matrix of relationalities by its

Correlational Class Analysis 17

mean. However, this approach only works under the assumption that the true mean
relationality between all the rows in the data is zero, or, equivalently, that
the relationality values are distributed symmetrically around their null value.
This is generally the case only if the proportion of respondents following a
schema without inverting it equals the proportion following its inverse 8—a
quantity I call inversion probability. For example, when this probability is
50%, the number of highbrow respondents following the schema “like classical,
like opera, dislike rock, dislike country” would equal the number of lowbrow
respondents following its inverse, “dislike classical, dislike opera, like
rock, like country”. However, since in reality the number of highbrow
respondents can differ greatly from the number of lowbrow respondents, there is
no reason to expect that the inversion probability generally equals 50%. This
suggests that RCA’s symmetry assumption may be frequently violated by empirical
data.

All the simulations presented above have granted RCA’s symmetry assumption by
keeping the inversion probability fixed at 50%. To examine the performance of
both algorithms when this assumption is relaxed, I created a second simulation
where the inversion probability is instead drawn from a uniform distribution
over its full range, and varies between each of the 5000 simulation runs 9. The
results of this second simulation are reported on the right side of Table 1. As
expected, both the median (0.86) and the interquartile range (0.69 to 0.97) of
CCA accuracies remain unchanged from the first simulation. On the other hand,
the median accuracy of RCA drops to 0.67, significantly lower than its prior
median of 0.74 (Wilcoxon W = 13802245, p < 0.0001), and below CCA’s 25th
percentile of accuracy. CCA is now more than 3 times as likely as RCA to

Correlational Class Analysis 18

produce a nearly perfect answer (NMI > 0.95), while RCA is more than 20 times
as likely to produce an almost completely incorrect one (NMI < 0.05). Thus,
RCA’s accuracy appears to suffer a significant further drop when its assumption
of symmetrical distribution is violated, as may generally happen in empirical
applications. CCA remains unaffected by this change.

The results of both simulations thus reinforce my earlier suppositions. Though
the accuracies of RCA and CCA were highly correlated, they nonetheless differed
in almost 95% of the 10000 combined simulation runs. In simulation 1, which
obeyed RCA’s symmetry assumption, the odds that CCA’s result was more accurate
exceeded 16:1. In simulation 2, where this assumption was relaxed, these odds
further rose to 23:1. CCA was more accurate over the full range of schema and
noise variances examined, thus providing no evidence of any category of cases
in which RCA would be preferable to CCA. On the other hand, when the schema
variance was low, RCA’s performance suffered a significant further drop
relative to CCA’s. Therefore, results from these 10000 simulations point to the
same conclusion as the introductory example: the correlationbased approach to
identifying schematic classes is more accurate than the one based on
relationality.

EMPIRICAL EXAMPLE: MUSICAL TASTES

To compare the results produced by the two methods in an empirical setting, I
applied CCA to the 1992 GSS music tastes module previously analyzed with RCA
(Goldberg 2011). This dataset contains 1532 respondents’ evaluations of 17
musical genres. Each respondent rated each genre using a five-point Likert
scale that ranges from “like very much” to “dislike very much”. For
comparability, I followed exactly the same coding procedures as Goldberg
(2011).

Goldberg’s RCA analyses partitioned the survey population into three schematic
classes, which he labelled “Omnivore – Univore”, “Highbrow – Lowbrow”, and
“Contemporary – Traditional.” For respondents in the “Omnivore – Univore”
class, most genre tastes were positively correlated among each other. Goldberg
interpreted this as evidence of a culturally omnivorous taste schema, in which
no genres are perceived as opposites, but rather a high appraisal of most
genres is opposed to a low appraisal of most genres. In the “Highbrow –
Lowbrow” class, tastes for “elitist” genres such as opera and classical music
were positively correlated among each other, but negatively correlated with
most tastes for popular genres. Finally, Goldberg characterizes the third
schematic class as “Contemporary – Traditional.” Here, a cluster of positively
correlated tastes for well-established musical genres including gospel,
bluegrass, and country is negatively correlated to tastes for arguably more
contemporary genres, including heavy metal, pop and rap, as well as oldies and
jazz. The persistence of the Highbrow – Lowbrow taste schema was perhaps
Goldberg’s most surprising finding, as much contemporary work has argued that
omnivorousness has replaced highbrow tastes as a marker of high status in the
contemporary United States (Peterson and Kern 1996; Peterson 1997, 2005; see
Goldberg 2011 for a more detailed discussion).

The CCA analyses of these data, however, cast doubt on this finding. While RCA
identified three classes in these data, CCA identified four, which are
presented in Figure 6 below. The first two of these closely resemble those
located by RCA. The first class features practically no negative correlations
between the genres, suggesting that respondents in this class perceive little
opposition between different musical styles. In this population, positive
appraisal of any one genre generally “goes with” positive appraisal of any
other genre, suggesting an undiscriminating logic of taste that ranges between
near-uniformly positive appraisals of all genres on one extreme, and a
nearuniformly negative appraisal of all genres on the other. This is the same
omnivorous logic as behind the Omnivore – Univore class identified by RCA.

[Figure 6 about here]

The second class located by CCA appears to be defined by an opposition between
rock, rap and metal on one extreme, and gospel, country, folk and bluegrass on
the other.  This suggests a bifurcation of respondents into those who prefer
newer musical genres and those who prefer more established ones, which closely
resembles the logic of the Contemporary – Traditional class identified by RCA.
However, while the RCA analyses had counterintuitively suggested that blues,
latin and jazz belong to the contemporary side of this schematic logic, the CCA
analyses instead suggest that blues belongs to the traditional side, whereas
latin and jazz straddle the two sides without clearly belonging to either.
Thus, while substantively similar, the Contemporary – Traditional class
identified by CCA appears to have greater face validity.

Goldberg’s most controversial claim concerns the remaining group of
respondents, who he contends follow a traditional logic which differentiates
between “highbrow” genres such as opera and classical music on the one extreme,
and popular “lowbrow” genres on the other. However, the CCA results contain no
evidence of such a class. Instead, CCA separates the remaining population into
two further schematic classes (see panels C and D of Figure 6). In both, the
majority of genres are tied together in a dense cluster of positive
correlations, thus suggesting that both are variants of an omnivorous taste
schema. These results resemble previous findings that documented the existence
of multiple distinct logics of omnivorousness (e.g., Tampubolon 2008).
However, the omnivorousness of respondents in these last two classes features
clear exceptions. In the class depicted on the left, a higher appraisal of most
genres is generally accompanied by a lower appraisal of heavy metal (and
frequently also rap music.) The class on the right exhibits a nearly identical
structure, except country and gospel music occupy the same position of
exclusion as metal and rap did in the class on the left. These patterns closely
echo the analyses of Bryson (1996), who famously showed that omnivores may
retain a symbolic boundary against genres most closely associated with low
education: heavy metal, rap, country and gospel music. Thus, drawing on the
title of Bryson’s work, I term these latter two classes “Anything (but) Heavy
Metal” and “Anything (but) Country”.

Table 2 cross-tabulates the group assignments made by the two algorithms. A
plurality (though not a majority) of respondents that RCA grouped into its
first two classes remain grouped together in the CCA results. However, the
respondents that belonged to RCA’s third class are completely dispersed. Such a
divergence between CCA and RCA class assignments is consistent with the
simulation analyses above, where the results of the two methods were correlated
but rarely the same, with CCA offering the more accurate answer in the
overwhelming majority of cases. While the simulations showed that this
difference is statistically reliable, these GSS analyses illustrate that it can
also be substantively important.

DISCUSSION

The Relational Class Analysis methodology (Goldberg 2011) aims to uncover
shared cultural schemas that organize the cultural tastes of distinct groups of
survey respondents. The method rests on an eponymous “relationality” measure to
quantify the extent that two respondents appear to share one cultural schema.
Though rhetorical arguments justifying this measure have been compelling, they
have lacked a solid formal underpinning. In this paper, I built on the
theoretical reasoning behind RCA to provide a formal definition of shared
cultural schemas, the latent construct that relationality is designed to
measure. This formal reasoning made it clear that schematic similarity as
conceived by Goldberg (2011) should manifest itself in linear dependency
between two response vectors—the same measurement task for which Pearson’s
correlation has long been an established solution.

When I applied Pearson’s correlation to the same example that Goldberg (2011)
used to introduce relationality, I found that correlation yielded substantially
more accurate results. To determine whether this difference extends to other
situations, I then analyzed 10000 diverse simulated datasets. These results
confirmed that Pearson’s correlation is a substantially more accurate measure
of schematic similarity than relationality. Across the full range of simulation
parameters, the accuracy of correlationbased CCA remained reliably higher than
that of relationality-based RCA. In those challenging simulations where schema
variances were low, CCA’s accuracy dropped to 0.38, but RCA’s dropped to 0.08.
Conversely, in the near absence of statistical noise, CCA’s accuracy approached
0.97, but RCA’s never rose above 0.85. When the two methods produced different
results, the odds that CCA’s answers were more accurate exceeded 16:1 even in
simulations that obeyed the strong distributional assumption introduced by
relationality. When the simulations violated this assumption, those odds rose
to 23:1. A re-analysis of the 1993 GSS musical tastes module confirmed that
these differences can lead to substantively different conclusions in empirical
settings. Thus, these analytical, computational and empirical results together
strongly suggest that there are substantial reasons to prefer the
correlation-based CCA methodology proposed here over the relationality-based
RCA.

Limitations and Future Directions

Proponents have argued that RCA “does not require any presuppositions”
(Goldberg and Baldassari forthcoming:3) about how attitudes are organized in
the population. This claim, however, may be misleading. While RCA indeed
inductively determines the specific cultural schemas and schematic class
assignments that describe a given empirical population, its ability to do so
rests on implicit theoretical assumptions about the general structure, function
and distribution of such classes and schemas. In the present paper, I
demonstrated the usefulness of laying out such presuppositions with greater
clarity.

While this paper has formally defined the concept of shared cultural schema,
however, there is still a second black box that remains to be opened. CCA, like
RCA, uses modularity maximization to partition the survey population into
schematic classes.  As the simulations in this paper demonstrate, it does so
with acceptable accuracy. But, while modularity maximization is among the most
widely used network analytic techniques across many disciplines (e.g., Neal
2014; Newman 2013; Shwed and Bearman 2010; Porter, Onnela, and Mucha 2009), its
use may introduce further assumptions. A substantial literature notes that
modularity maximization suffers from a “resolution limit” that biases it
against detecting both very small and very large modules in many empirical
settings, joining even very different modules together when they are too small
in proportion to the whole network, and conversely breaking apart modules that
are too large (Fortunato and Barthélemy 2007; Lancichinetti and Fortunato 2011;
for a thorough overview, see Good, de Montjoye, and Clauset 2010).

By relying on modularity maximization, RCA and CCA may thus unintentionally
introduce an assumption that each member of the survey population belongs to
one of a moderate number of schematic classes, and may produce misleading
results when this is not the case—e.g., in situations where many respondents
follow their own idiosyncratic response patterns, or where the whole population
belongs to only one schematic class.  Future methodological work should
determine whether these methods indeed exhibit this problem, and offer
solutions if they do 10. Before such work takes place, however, it may be
prudent for empirical researchers to seek external evidence that the population
under study features the kind of heterogeneity RCA and CCA are designed to
seek.

CONCLUSION

In this paper, I demonstrated that Pearson’s correlation is a better measure of
schematic similarity than the relationality measure introduced by Goldberg
(2011).  Correlational Class Analysis (CCA) proved reliably more accurate at
partitioning survey populations by shared cultural schema than RCA. This change
from relationality to correlation may bring a number of further benefits.
Relationality is substantially more computationally costly to calculate than
correlation, and also requires bias correction and extensive bootstrapping for
significance testing. Correlation obviates the need for these further steps.
This leaves an algorithm that is clear, fast and easy to implement (see
Appendix A). It also clarifies and standardizes the method, thus placing it in
conversation with existing methodologies in other disciplines—e.g., the
correlation network approaches in bioinformatics which employ very similar
analytical steps in a different empirical domain (e.g., Langfelder and Horvath
2007). Future improvements of CCA can draw insights from these existing
literatures, thus helping further build on Goldberg’s methodological
innovations.

APPENDIXES

Appendix A. CCA Algorithm

Correlational class analysis can be implemented in minutes in any programming
environment which supports network partitioning by modularity maximization. It consists
of only four steps:
  1. Create a matrix G of absolute row correlations between survey respondents.
  2. Set statistically insignificant correlations to 0 to reduce noise (e.g., using t-tests 11).
  3. Import G into a network analysis package, treating it as an adjacency matrix.
  4. Use the existing network partitioning routines to produce the group assignments.
In the R statistical environment with the igraph 0.7 library, this can be implemented as:
CCA <- function (dataset, min.significant.row.cor =
{
C <- abs(cor(t(dataset)))
# 1st
C[C < min.significant.row.cor] <- 0
# 2nd
G <- graph.adjacency(C, mode="undirected",
weighted = TRUE, diag = FALSE)
# 3rd
leading.eigenvector.community(G)$membership # 4th

0.60)
step
step
step
step

}
A more full-featured implementation of the method is available on CRAN under the name
“corclass”.
Since correlation is normalized by the product of variances, it is undefined when
the variance of either respondent equals zero. The minimal implementation above
requires that such respondents be dropped from the analysis, which may generally be an
acceptable solution given the rarity of such respondents in empirical survey data.

Correlational Class Analysis 27

However, to keep CCA’s results comparable to RCA’s, the algorithm I use to analyze the
simulated datasets instead sets correlations between two zero-variance respondents to 1,
and their correlations with others to 0.

Appendix B. Simulation Procedure
Each of the 5000 simulations is generated in three steps:
1) I first randomly set the maximum ranges of various broad simulation parameters
by drawing them from the uniform distribution: schema variance 𝜐 ~ 𝑈[0.3,3],
noise variance 𝜖 ~ 𝑈[0,3], maximum shift 𝛿 ~ 𝑈{0, … ,3} maximum scaling
𝛾 ~ 𝑈{1, … ,3}, and number of schematic classes 𝑐 ~ 𝑈{2, … ,6}.
2) Then, for each of the 𝑐 classes, I randomly generate a schema vector 𝜌 =
{𝜌1 , … 𝜌10 } by drawing from the Normal distribution, 𝜌 𝑖 ~ 𝑁(𝜇 = 0, 𝜎 2 = 𝜐), and
rounding to the nearest integer. Any duplicate vectors are discarded, and new
vectors generated in their place, until I have 𝑐 unique vectors. Then, I randomly
set the counts 𝑛1 , … , 𝑛 𝑘 of respondents in each schematic class,
𝑛 𝑖 ~ 𝑈{100, … ,500}. The range of the 10 taste variables is then fixed at
±[max(|𝑝 𝑖 |) ∗ 𝛾 + 𝛿].
3) Finally, for each respondent 𝑓 ∈ �1, 𝑛 𝑝 � following schema 𝜌 𝑝 , I simulate the
response 𝑋 𝑝𝑓 = �𝑘 𝑓 ∗ 𝜌 𝑝 � + 𝛿 𝑓 + 𝜖 𝑓 by drawing the values of the vertical shift
𝛿 𝑓 ~ 𝑈{−𝛿, … , 𝛿} and the scaling and inversion factor 𝑘 𝑓 ~ 𝑈{[−𝛾, … , −1] ∪
[1, … , 𝛾]}. I generate each respondent’s noise vector 𝜖 𝑓 by first drawing an

Correlational Class Analysis 28

individual noise variance Ε 𝑓 ~ 𝑈(0, 𝜖), and then drawing each
element, 𝜖 𝑓𝑖 ~ 𝑁(𝜇 = 0, 𝜎 2 = 𝜖 𝑓 ), rounded to the nearest integer.
I analyzed each simulation run using both CCA and RCA (Goldberg and Zhai 2013), and
then compared the results.

ENDNOTES
1

In Martin’s (2002) terminology, such schemas thus underlie the “tightness” rather than

the “consensus” of a system of attitudes. If one imagines attitudes as an abstract space
where each dimension represents a like/dislike of a given musical genre, such schemas
would specify an axis along which culturally valid tastes can be arranged rather than
specifying a specific point in space at which tastes should be located.
2

Formally, Goldberg (2011) defines the relationality between two respondents i and j to

equal 𝑅 𝑖𝑗 =

2
𝐾(𝐾−1)

𝑘𝑙
𝑘𝑙
𝑘𝑙
𝐾−1
𝐾
∑ 𝑘=1 ∑ 𝑙=𝑘+1(𝜆 𝑖𝑗 ∗ 𝛿 𝑖𝑗 ), where 𝛿 𝑖𝑗 = 1 − |�Δ𝑋 𝑖 𝑘𝑙 � − | Δ𝑋 𝑗 𝑘𝑙 |, and

where Δ𝑋 𝑖 𝑘𝑙 = 𝑋 𝑖 𝑘 − 𝑋 𝑖𝑙 is the difference between the values of the variables k and l for
𝑘𝑙
𝑘𝑙
respondent i, and 𝜆 𝑖𝑗 = 1 if Δ𝑋 𝑖 𝑘𝑙 and Δ𝑋 𝑗 𝑘𝑙 have the same sign, and 𝜆 𝑖𝑗 = −1 otherwise.

The matrix of relationalities is then re-centered by its mean to correct for its bias under
the assumption that the true mean value of 𝑅 𝑖𝑗 = 0.
3

Respondents are assigned to classes based on the absolute values of the relationalities

|𝑅 𝑖𝑗 |, so I plot the values |𝑅 𝑖𝑗 | instead of 𝑅 𝑖𝑗 to enable easier visual comparison of their
magnitudes. I also omit the Euclidean distances, which are not relevant to the present
discussion. These changes make the limited dynamic range of relationality values more
visually apparent. Since Goldberg does not present the numerical relationality scores for
this example, I reproduce these values by measuring the bar lengths in his figure.
4

When I ran RCA with default parameters, it partitioned the population into 800 separate

classes, thus assigning even identical rows to different classes. This obviously faulty

Correlational Class Analysis 30

solution appears to be due to the pseudo-significance testing RCA uses to filter weak
relationalities, which is based on strong assumptions about how relationalities are
distributed in the data. Disabling it produced the substantially more realistic solution I
report above. (As I discuss below, this filter appears to generally decrease the average
accuracy of RCA.)
5

For example, the schema shared by A, B and C in Figure 1 can be specified as 𝜌 =

{0,0,0,1,1, −1, −1}, so that 𝐴 = 𝜌 + 4, 𝐵 = 𝜌 + 2, and 𝐶 = −2𝜌 + 3.
6

Because of an apparent bug, the RCA software repeatedly crashed for 69 (1.3%) of

these simulated datasets, producing no results. I excluded these cases from the analysis.
7

RCA software contains a user-configurable filtering step where weak relationalities are

dropped prior to partitioning. I examined how filtering affected RCA’s performance
using 250 simulation runs. Filtering increased accuracy in 56% of the cases but and
decreased it in 43%. However, the average decrease (-0.33) was three times greater than
the average increase (0.11). Overall, disabling the filter substantially raised RCA’s
median accuracy, from 0.56 when enabled to 0.69 when disabled. Additionally, in 10% of
the cases with filtering, RCA encountered an error and yielded no solution at all (as
compared to 1% without filtering). Thus, to increase RCA’s accuracy and avoid potential
bias from substantial missing results, I disabled the filter for all the simulations reported
in this paper.
8

It can also hold in a number of degenerate or improbable cases—e.g., when there are

roughly as many taste schemas as there are respondents.

Correlational Class Analysis 31

The changes to the simulation procedure described in Appendix B are as follows. In

step 1, I now also draw a random inversion probability: 𝜁~𝑈[0,0.5]. In step 3, I now
draw a random inversion factor 𝑧 𝑓 ∈ {1, −1}, with 𝑃�𝑧 𝑓 = −1� = 𝜁. Since factor 𝑘 𝑓 now
controls the scaling but not the inversion, I now restrict it to positive values: 𝑘 𝑓 ~ 𝑈[1, 𝛾].
Each respondent 𝑓 following schema 𝜌 𝑝 is generated by 𝑋 𝑝𝑓 = �𝑧 𝑓 ∗ 𝑘 𝑓 ∗ 𝜌 𝑝 � + 𝛿 𝑓 + 𝜖 𝑓 .
10

For an example of a domain-specific fix to problems stemming from modularity’s

resolution limit, see Sohn and colleagues (2011).
11

My exploratory results suggest that more stringent cutoffs may produce more accurate

results as long as they are not so extreme as to turn some nodes into isolates. I used
𝛼 = 0.05 as the cutoff for the simulations reported above, and 𝛼 = 0.01 for the GSS
analyses. A min.significant.row.cor of 0.60 approximates a t-test at 𝛼 = 0.01
for rows of 17 variables.
